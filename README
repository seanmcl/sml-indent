Indentation in sml-mode doesn't work well.  Trying to understand someone else's
elisp code is a daunting task. In this case it involved tracking emacs' point
through various recursive functions.  Even with edebug it is painful.

This is an SML program that indents SML code.  It is fast enough to rebind
TAB to indent the entire file.  A 23k line file (hamlet.sml in the tests directory)
takes about .3 seconds to indent.


* Misc
Symbols can pop multiple stack elements.  E.g. the second 'val'
pops the context of the first val.

val x = 5
val y = 5

* Indenting comments:

orig-indent


____(*
________foo works like this
___*)
      fun foo x =


______(*
__________foo works like this
______*)
      fun foo x =



____(*
________foo works like this *)
      fun foo x =


______(*
__________foo works like this *)
      fun foo x =

____(*
________foo works like this
___________and this
__*)
      fun foo x =

______(*
__________foo works like this
_____________and this
______*)
      fun foo x =

* Problems with indent.sml I don't care about.

fun f x = 5
  | f y =
   5

I don't use fun for pattern matching.  I only use fn for this. *)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

val f = fn x => x
 | y = 6

I'd write

val f = fn
   x => x
 | y = 6

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

val f = case f
   x
   of
   x => 5
 | y => 6

I'd write

val f =
  case
    f x
  of x => 5
   | y => 6

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

val _ =
   5
   handle A => 6
    | B => 7

I'd write

val _ =
   5
   handle
      A => 6
    | B => 7

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

if a then b
else if c
   orelse d
then e
else f

This is hard to fix.  We'd want

if a then b
else if c
        orelse d
then e
else f

but this would make the andalso/orelse handling much more difficult.  Both
alternatives work:

if a then b
else
   if c
      orelse d
then e
else f

if a then b
else if
   c
   orelse d
then e
else f
